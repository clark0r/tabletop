  "narrative_intro": "It starts quietly. A member of the finance team flags a wire request that seems… off. It’s from the CFO’s real email, addressed to the right people, but the language is unusually terse. The request is to transfer $325,000 to a new vendor in Singapore.\n\nWithin minutes, it becomes clear: the CFO’s account has been compromised. And they aren’t alone.\n\nIT security discovers login activity to the CFO’s Microsoft 365 account from a foreign IP in Ukraine. Rules have been added to forward emails silently. The account was used to message both finance and legal. There’s no evidence of malware on the device — this was a cloud-only compromise.\n\nSome money has already been transferred. The attacker may have had access for over a week.\n\nThis exercise simulates a high-trust business process compromise. It explores leadership alignment on fraud handling, internal trust, legal exposure, and strategic response in a sensitive, non-technical breach.",
