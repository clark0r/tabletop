  "narrative_intro": "It's a regular Tuesday morning. The office is quiet, Slack is lighting up with normal chatter, and the week’s projects are in full swing. But within the hour, something changes.\n\nAn executive assistant reports that they can’t access financial spreadsheets. Shortly after, IT helpdesk gets flooded with tickets — files won't open, and strange filenames are appearing across departments.\n\nThen it hits. A text file appears on dozens of systems: 'READ_ME_TO_DECRYPT.txt'. A ransom note.\n\nIt’s unclear how widespread the issue is. There are no automated alerts yet. In the next few hours, the executive team will need to make decisions that affect operations, legal exposure, employee confidence, public reputation, and possibly the future of the company.\n\nThis exercise simulates the pressure of an evolving ransomware incident. You will need to decide how to communicate internally and externally, when to escalate, how to approach ransom demands, and how to restore trust in the business. This is a leadership challenge as much as a technical one.",
