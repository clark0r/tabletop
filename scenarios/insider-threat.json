  "narrative_intro": "A departing employee had access to critical product documentation, internal tools, and customer data. The person left amicably — no red flags, no exit interview issues. But three weeks after their last day, a competitor launches a product with striking similarities to your roadmap.\n\nAt first, it seems like a coincidence. But then someone notices file download activity from the former employee’s account on their last day — hundreds of PDFs and spreadsheets. An internal ticket reveals a late-terminated GitHub access token. The competitor's blog post uses phrasing from a confidential whitepaper.\n\nLegal, HR, and Security must collaborate — quickly — to investigate what happened, determine the exposure, and consider options. This exercise explores insider risk, employee lifecycle controls, and balancing legal action with company culture.",
