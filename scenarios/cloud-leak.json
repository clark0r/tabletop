  "narrative_intro": "A third-party security researcher contacts your company via a public tip line. They discovered an S3 bucket that appears to belong to your domain — publicly accessible, with no authentication. Inside? Logs, support call transcripts, and screenshots containing customer names and credentials.\n\nWithin hours, the story hits social media, tagging your main brand account. The link shows thousands of files — accessible to anyone. Your AWS team scrambles to confirm ownership. Slack is on fire. The PR team starts asking, “What should we say?”\n\nThis tabletop explores detection of a misconfiguration with real-world impact, under public scrutiny. It tests your team's ability to control messaging, scope data loss, engage stakeholders, and coordinate a transparent response.",
