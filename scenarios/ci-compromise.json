  "narrative_intro": "You’re mid-sprint in a normal week. Engineering is pushing hard toward a product milestone. A staging deployment goes out overnight — but no one owns the commit. A CI job ran using an unknown token. DevOps starts digging.\n\nWithin the hour, it becomes clear: your CI pipeline has been compromised. Logs show access to build artifacts, secret keys, and Git repositories. One production image may have been tampered with. Worse, there's no definitive way to prove which builds are clean. The attacker may have introduced backdoors — and your customers are already running the code.\n\nCustomers trust your software. Partners embed your binaries. Some of your code may even run in regulated environments. The software factory is broken. How do you lead through this?",
